# Amazon Leadership Principles

Amazon uses these 16 Leadership Principles as the foundation for their culture and decision-making process. During SDE II interviews, you'll be asked behavioral questions that assess how well you embody these principles.

## 1. Customer Obsession
**Description:** Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

**Interview Focus:** How you prioritize customer needs, gather customer feedback, and make decisions that benefit customers even when difficult.

## 2. Ownership
**Description:** Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."

**Interview Focus:** How you take responsibility for problems outside your scope, think about long-term implications, and follow through on commitments.

## 3. Invent and Simplify
**Description:** Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

**Interview Focus:** How you innovate, simplify complex processes, and challenge conventional approaches to solve problems.

## 4. Are Right, A Lot
**Description:** Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**Interview Focus:** How you make decisions, incorporate diverse viewpoints, and adjust your thinking when presented with new information.

## 5. Learn and Be Curious
**Description:** Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**Interview Focus:** How you continuously learn new technologies, seek feedback, and improve your skills over time.

## 6. Hire and Develop the Best
**Description:** Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.

**Interview Focus:** How you help develop team members, provide constructive feedback, and raise the bar for performance.

## 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
**Description:** Leaders have relentlessly high standards â€” many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

**Interview Focus:** How you maintain high quality standards, address technical debt, and improve processes.

## 8. Think Big
**Description:** Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**Interview Focus:** How you approach large-scale problems, think beyond immediate constraints, and create innovative solutions.

## 9. Bias for Action
**Description:** Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**Interview Focus:** How you take initiative, make timely decisions with incomplete information, and balance speed with quality.

## 10. Frugality
**Description:** Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

**Interview Focus:** How you optimize resources, find efficient solutions, and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## 11. Earn Trust
**Description:** Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

**Interview Focus:** How you build trust with teammates, communicate transparently, and admit mistakes.

## 12. Dive Deep
**Description:** Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

**Interview Focus:** How you understand technical details, investigate issues thoroughly, and validate assumptions with data.

## 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
**Description:** Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

**Interview Focus:** How you constructively challenge ideas, stand up for your beliefs, and commit to team decisions even when you initially disagreed.

## 14. Deliver Results
**Description:** Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

**Interview Focus:** How you overcome obstacles, prioritize work, and consistently deliver high-quality results.

## 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
**Description:** Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun.

**Interview Focus:** How you contribute to a positive work environment, support diversity and inclusion, and help others succeed.

## 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
**Description:** We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions.

**Interview Focus:** How you consider the broader impact of your work, make ethical decisions, and take responsibility for outcomes.

## Preparing for Leadership Principles Questions

For each principle:
1. Identify 2-3 specific examples from your experience that demonstrate the principle
2. Structure your answers using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
3. Focus on your individual contributions, even when discussing team efforts
4. Quantify results and impact whenever possible
5. Be prepared to dive deep into the technical details of your examples

Remember that Amazon interviewers are looking for specific examples, not hypothetical responses or general philosophies. They want to understand how you've applied these principles in your past work.
